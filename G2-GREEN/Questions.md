## ğŸŸ© `Question #2`

### `Instructions:`
Write a method named "GenReal" to generate and return random real numbers. The following are the requirements of the method:

- Takes/receives one parameter named "maxVal". This parameter represents the maximum possible value of generated data.

- Randomly generates 150 points/items of real numbers in the range of [-1.0, maxVal] (-1.0 to the value defined by the "maxVal"). 

- Returns an array of the generated data.
