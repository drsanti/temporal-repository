## `Problem #1`

### `Instructions:`
Write a method named "GenIntData" to generate and return random integers. The following are the requirements of the method:

- Takes/receives one parameter named "nItems". This parameter represents the number of points/items of generated data.

- Randomly generates integers in the range of [-2, 5] (-2 to 5).

- Returns an array of generated data.

## `Problem #2`

### `Instructions:`
Write a method named "GenRealNumbers" to generate and return random real numbers. The following are the requirements of the method:

- Takes/receives one parameter named "maximum". This parameter represents the maximum possible value of generated data.

- Randomly generates 55 points/items of real numbers in the range of [-5.0, maxVal] (-5.0 to the value defined by the "maxVal"). 

- Returns an array of generated data.
